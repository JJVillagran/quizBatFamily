    <p> Helldivers 2 is a co-op PvE game that takes its story and gameplay inspiration from the 1997 sci-fi film Starship Troopers. 
      Both the film and game have satirical messages about propganda and the military overall. 
      The movie is considered a masterpiece when it comes to showing the flaws in fascism and a "managed democracy".
      Helldivers 2 is only $40. Anyway, buy Helldivers, and let me know when you do so I can add you as a friend!
